        <p class="text_light">This is my PC! Custom built by me back in mid-2025. It was originally in an ATX case which was later swapped out for this MATX case and motherboard.</p>
        <p class="text_light">Here's the spec list:</p>
        <ul class="text_light">
            <li>Case: Lian Li A3-mATX</li>
            <li>CPU: Ryzen 9 7950X3D</li>
            <li>GPU: Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XT</li>
            <li>Motherboard: B650M AORUS ELITE AX ICE</li>
            <li>RAM: G.Skill Flare X5 32GB DDR5-6000</li>
            <li>CPU Cooler: Thermaltake TH360 V2</li>
            <li>PSU: Lian Li SP850</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text_light">The GPU was painted white because the original build was full black until i switched to the MATX motherboard/case and decided to get a few white things. The paint i used was Plasti-Dip which is more of a rubbery coating than a paint, and it's worked wondefully. I've yet to see if it peels off well but it's held up perfectly for months now so i definitely reccomend that method if you're going to paint a GPU. I did have to remove the shroud to paint it, but that's fairly easy. I also got some PTM7950 and swapped out the default thermal paste on the GPU with that and got a few degress lower temps so that's quite nice.</p>

        <p class="text_light">This is my keyboard! It's a Drop + OLKB Planck V7 with the aluminium case, Vertex V1 switches, and Typeplus x YiKB stabilizers. The keycaps are 3D printed purely because I didn't get any to go with the keyboard and needed a "temporary" solution. The color also doesn't look good right now because they fit with the old theme of my setup and the 3D printed case I used for a bit but don't fit well anymore. What mappers most is that they work and they're suprisingly comfortable to use given the layer lines. One thing I really do need to get for it though is a plate since the keys do not stay in place well right now without one. I've tried to use a 3D printed plate in the past but it just bent when i tried to install it and didn't work well. I imagine it would work better if printed with a more rigid filament. I've used the Protopasta carbon fibre HTPLA and that stuff is really still after being oven annealed but it's probably not worth the time and money over just buying a regular plate.</p>

        <p class="text_light">This is my hyprland config! It's mainly celeste themed but the colorscheme is Catppuccin Macchiato (same as this website). The bar is Waybar and it's fairly similar to the default config just with some styling and fixed to work well with hyprland. I did mess up the icons on waybar somehow, probably something to do with fonts but it's not a big issue. I use Kitty for the terminal, Mako for notification daemon, and Vicinae for app launcher. The dotfiles aren't public as i made them a while ago and probably stole frome some other configs which i couldn't properly credit/check that that's even allowed. I do plan on remaking it all myself at some point and making them public but i'm not sure if i want to put in the effort to maintain that.</p>
