        <p class="text_light">This is my server setup, I've got one that has a ryzen 5 5600x and RX 570 and the other is a laptop with an i7-9750H and RTX 2060. Currently i'm just running invidious, nextcloud, and a minecraft server on the 5600x one. On the laptop i'm running pihole and another minecraft server.</p>
        <p class="text_light">I have the parts other than a motherboard and GPU to build a third server so I'll probably set that up when I have the money. Although currently they're just set up on a windowledge which doesn't have space for a third server so I'll have to figure out an alterative to that.</p>
